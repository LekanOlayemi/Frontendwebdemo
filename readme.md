## LO!..history of GOD

In the beginning, human beings created a God who was the First Cause of all things and Ruler of heaven and earth. He was
not represented by images and had no temple or priests in his service. He was too exalted for an inadequate human cult.
Gradually he faded from the consciousness of his people. He had become so remote that they decided that they did not
want him any more. Eventually he was said to have disappeared.
